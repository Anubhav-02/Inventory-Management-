# üì¶ Product Inventory API (Backend Only)

This project is a **backend application** (no user interface yet) that helps manage products in an **Inventory System**.  
It is built using **C#** and **.NET Core** with a lightweight database (**SQLite**).  

You can use this backend to:  
- ‚ûï Add new products  
- üìã View all products  
- üîç Search & filter products  
- ‚úèÔ∏è Update product details  
- ‚ùå Delete products
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Check for **low stock products** (less than or equal to 5 items left)

## üõ† What Technologies Are Used?

- **C#** ‚Üí A programming language made by Microsoft.  
- **.NET Core** ‚Üí A free framework to build applications (the engine running this backend).  
- **SQLite** ‚Üí A small database saved as a file (used here to store products).  
- **Postman** ‚Üí A tool that shows all available APIs in a simple webpage, so you can test them without coding.

## ‚ùì FAQ (For Non-Coders)

**Q: What is .NET?**  
A free framework by Microsoft that lets us build apps (like the engine that runs this project).  

**Q: Do I need to code anything?**  
No. You just need to run commands like `dotnet run`. Swagger will give you buttons to click.  

**Q: Where do I see my products?**  
Right now, only in **Swagger** or **Postman** (API testing tools). A separate frontend (website) can be built later.
