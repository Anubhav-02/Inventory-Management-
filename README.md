# 📦 Product Inventory API (Backend Only)

This project is a **backend application** (no user interface yet) that helps manage products in an **Inventory System**.  
It is built using **C#** and **.NET Core** with a lightweight database (**SQLite**).  

You can use this backend to:  
- ➕ Add new products  
- 📋 View all products  
- 🔍 Search & filter products  
- ✏️ Update product details  
- ❌ Delete products (soft delete)  
- ⚠️ Check for **low stock products** (less than 5 items left)  

---

## 🛠 What Technologies Are Used?

- **C#** → A programming language made by Microsoft.  
- **.NET Core** → A free framework to build applications (the engine running this backend).  
- **SQLite** → A small database saved as a file (used here to store products).  
- **Swagger** → A tool that shows all available APIs in a simple webpage, so you can test them without coding.

## ▶️ Running the Backend

1. Open a terminal (**Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**).  
2. Navigate to the project folder (where `ProductInventoryApi.csproj` exists). Example:  
   ```bash
   cd Inventory-Management-/ProductInventoryApi
   ```
3. Run the project with:  
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
4. You should see something like:  
   ```
   Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
   Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
   ```

✅ This means your backend is running on **http://localhost:5000**

## 🌐 Using the API (No Coding Needed)

1. Open your browser and go to:  
   👉 [http://localhost:5000/swagger](http://localhost:5000/swagger)  

2. You will see a webpage with the following APIs:  
   - **POST /api/products** → Add a new product  
   - **GET /api/products** → View all products  
   - **GET /api/products/{id}** → View product by ID  
   - **PUT /api/products/{id}** → Update a product  
   - **DELETE /api/products/{id}** → Soft delete (mark inactive)  
   - **GET /api/products/lowstock** → Check products with stock < 5  

3. Just click any API, enter the values, and press **Execute**.  

💡 Example:  
- To add a product → Click **POST /api/products**, then fill details like `Name`, `Price`, `Category` → Execute → ✅ Done!

## 📂 Database Info

- The project uses a **SQLite database file** called `products.db`.  
- You don’t need to install anything extra. It’s already included.  
- If you delete `products.db`, a new one will be created automatically.

## ❓ FAQ (For Non-Coders)

**Q: What is .NET?**  
A free framework by Microsoft that lets us build apps (like the engine that runs this project).  

**Q: Do I need to code anything?**  
No. You just need to run commands like `dotnet run`. Swagger will give you buttons to click.  

**Q: Where do I see my products?**  
Right now, only in **Swagger** or **Postman** (API testing tools). A separate frontend (website) can be built later.
