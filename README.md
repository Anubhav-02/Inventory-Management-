# 📦 Product Inventory API (Backend Only)

This project is a **backend application** (no user interface yet) that helps manage products in an **Inventory System**.  
It is built using **C#** and **.NET Core** with a lightweight database (**SQLite**).  

You can use this backend to:  
- ➕ Add new products  
- 📋 View all products  
- 🔍 Search & filter products  
- ✏️ Update product details  
- ❌ Delete products 
- ⚠️ Check for **low stock products** (less than 5 items left)  

---

## 🛠 What Technologies Are Used?
- **C#** → A programming language made by Microsoft.  
- **.NET Core** → A free framework to build applications (the engine running this backend).  
- **SQLite** → A small database saved as a file (used here to store products).  
- **Postman** → A tool that shows all available APIs in a simple webpage, so you can test them without coding.

## Test API using Postman
[Postman Collection URL](https://.postman.co/workspace/My-Workspace~9106ab3a-a3d7-4634-8f0d-d107dbaed5b7/request/42616923-e4a60cf9-e549-444e-a176-a4f54cf72a04?action=share&creator=42616923&ctx=documentation&active-environment=42616923-5c257926-88ba-411f-ae2f-d1886a17c557) 

Just click any API, enter the values, and press **Execute**.  

💡 Example:  
- To add a product → Click **POST /api/products**, then fill details like `Name`, `Price`, `Category` → Execute → ✅ Done!

## 📂 Database Info

- The project uses a **SQLite database file** called `products.db`.  
- You don’t need to install anything extra. It’s already included.  
- If you delete `products.db`, a new one will be created automatically.
